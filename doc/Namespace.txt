Nested Namespaces:

Plan:
  The goal is that nested namespaces will feel similar to the module like import system in a language like python.
  The top level should not be a namespace. (If it is an actual namespace object, it should not actually allow for the creation of modules/generators/typegens)
  The context should create a single top, but every time it loads a new file, it should be loaded into a boxed top. After that it can be merged.

  Within each namespace, you can create new namespaces, and you can import namespaces.

  You are only allowed to use modules in your own current namespace/downstream namespaces OR namespaces that were explicitly imported into the current namespace.
